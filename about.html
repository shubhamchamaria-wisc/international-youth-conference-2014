<span style="color:#00AABB;font-size:1.4em;text-align:center;">About IYC</span><br /><br />
		<span>JNS-IYC carries the history of eight years; it culminates the legends of eight journeys. The founding members of IYC take pride in not emulating yet another MUN but crafting an all-exclusive simulated diplomatic conference where resolutions precede issues and actions succeed ideas. 
The uniqueness of IYC also lies in the fact that is organized completely by a democratically elected student body and Organization Committee. The backstage organization of the event is youth-led, youth-determined and youth- created. Students are the leading speakers and thinkers at JNS-IYC- be it conducting the committee or coordinating it.<br /><br />
Its humble first chapter saw the opening of two committees- G8 and G20 and at the threshold of 2014, we have five committees to offer. The burgeoning number of registrations has only filled the committee halls with both national and international students with representatives from Germany and The Netherlands. 
We hope to see you amongst this international audience on 4th and 5th October, 2014.</span>

    <span>Meet Jash of the House Vatsaraj, First of His Name and President of IYC 2014. This sharp tongued, innuendo aficionado is as assertive as arrogant, as honest as hardworking. He is straight forward and opinionated. His passion for IYC and knowledge about MUNs lead him to work to the best of his skill, to procure his aim of setting a higher benchmark for the quality of debate at IYC. He will accept only the best from his team, to achieve his goal of making IYC 2014 a top notch and fulfilling experience. He is known for his twitter obsession, football blog and commitment to his cause. He excels under immense responsibility and pressure, and that is why he succeeds at almost everything. If Football is a culture, Manchester United is his religion; Wayne Rooney is his God and Old Trafford his Mecca. If you ever want to have a 24 hour conversation about football, TV shows or food, don't hesitate to approach him!</span>

The perfect combination of commitment, determination and discipline, he will be the perfect hulking, imposing and bouncer-like slavedriver! Rest assured that IYC will be a safe place to bring out those MUN-ing skills. Although his face suggests innocence, he won't take a second to turn into your biggest nightmare if you behave in a way that he perceives as less than "sort".</span>

    <span>This sub admin is one you'd hate to be on the wrong side of. While she may seem happy (read hysterical), when she gets down to business, there's nothing that can get in her way. Intelligent, caring and spontaneous, she effectively puts people in their place (especially when it's a grammatical error). But find yourself in a time of need, and she'll be the first one to go out of her way to help you out.

A fun, level-headed person, there is not one minute you can spend with her and get bored. Her honesty and integrity sets her apart, as one cannot expect anything less than 110% from Jahnavi. With her running IYC, we can assure you, it will surely be a memorable conference. As the IBDP Representative, she has managed to take upon herself the kind of responsibility that very few people can manage. Her leadership and her natural affinity for change, makes her such an integral part of this event. In times of distress, her smile is often what keeps us going. A writer,  dancer, an artist, and one who loves to travel, she will truly bring internationalism to the event. This global citizen raises the standards to those expected from any world leader.
